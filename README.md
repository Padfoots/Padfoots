## 👋 Hi there! I'm Youssef 

It all started when I was 14 years old, rooting my Android phone. I remember the excitement of removing the stock OS and installing CyanogenMod using ADB shell commands in a terminal. That’s when I realized—computers are my passion 💻, and I wanted to learn everything happening inside that mysterious "black box."

Since then, I’ve graduated with a degree in Computer Science 🎓, and now I’m on the lookout for a role in **Backend Web Development**, ideally writing **Python** 🐍. I’d love to work in a startup environment with a close-knit team, where I can make a meaningful impact from day one 🚀.

### 🚀 What I'm up to:
- 💻 Currently learning **AWS** ☁️ and diving deep into **CI/CD** pipelines.
- 💡 Founder of [Scrapify.site](http://scrapify.site), a project that lets users scrape and download Spotify playlists for free 🎶.
- 🤝 Always open to chat—especially if you're hiring!

If you're looking for someone who's passionate about coding, eager to learn, and ready to contribute, let's connect! You can reach out to me via GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

Thanks for stopping by! 😄
